Before jumping into hacking you will first learn how to set up a lab and install needed software (works on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux), then the course is structured in a way that will take you through the basics of linux, computer systems, networks and how devices communicate with each other, then you will learn how to exploit this method of communication to carry out a number of powerful attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Course is Divided into three main sections: \r\n\r\nPre-connection attacks: In this section you will learn how networks work, how devices communicate with each other and how the information is transferred in a wireless networks. You will also learn some basic terminology, what is a channel ? MAC address ? what is managed mode ? What is monitor mode  and how to enable it ? what is sniffing and what is it limited to ? so in this section we still don't know much about penetration testing , all we have is a computer and a wireless card connected to it, you will learn how to start gathering information using your wi-fi card (packet sniffing) and you will learn  how to control connections around you (ie: deny/allow devices from connecting to networks) without knowing the password of the target network.\r\n\r\nGaining Access: Now that you gathered information about the networks around you, in this section you will learn a number of methods to crack the key and get the password to your target network whether it uses WEP, WPA or even WPA2.\r\n\r\nPost Connection attacks: Now that you have the key, you can connect to the target network, in this section you will learn a number of powerful techniques that allow you to gather comprehensive information about the connected devices, see anything they do on the internet (such as login information, passwords, visited urls, images, videos ....etc), redirect requests, inject evil code in loaded pages and even gain full control over connected clients!

In this course, you will start as a beginner with no previous knowledge in hacking, and by the end of it you'll be at a high level in social engineering being able hack into all major operating systems (windows, OS X, Linux and Android) like black-hat hackers and secure yourself from hackers.\r\n\r\nThis course is focused on the practical side of social engineering without neglecting the theory, first you'll learn how to install the needed software (on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X), then the course is divided into a number of sections to represent the steps you'd take to successfully hack a target using social engineering.\r\n\r\n1. Information Gathering - First before doing anything you need to know your target, in this section you'll learn how to gather information about your target whether it is a company, website or just a person. You will learn how to discover anything that is associated with your target such as websites, links, companies, users, emails, phone numbers, friends, social networks accounts ...etc, you will also learn how to graph all of this information and use it to build a smart attack strategy.\r\n\r\n2. Generating Malware  - Now that you gathered enough information about your target and came up with an attack strategy, the next step is create custom malware that is attractive to the target. In this section you will learn how to generate evil files (files that execute tasks you want on the target computer), this includes backdoors, keyloggers, credential harvester and more, these files will work on all operating systems (Windows, OS X, Linux and Android), you'll also learn how to enhance these files to make them bypass all anti-virus programs, and make them look and function just like any other file such as an image or a pdf,  or even embed them in legitimate Microsoft Office documents. \r\n\r\n3. Delivery Methods - Now that you have your custom-made trojan ready, in this section you will learn a number of social engineering techniques to deliver it to the target, you will learn how to create fake websites that look identical to websites the target trusts, send emails that appear like they're coming from people the target trusts and use fake login pages and fake updates to hack into the target, you'll also learn advanced social engineering techniques to lure the target into visiting an evil URL and hack into their system without even interacting with them.\r\n\r\n4. Post Exploitation - In this section you will learn how to interact with the systems you compromised whether they use Windows, Linux, OS X or even Android. YouÆll learn how to access the file system (read/write/upload/execute), maintain your access, escalate your privileges, spy on the target, use the target computer as a pivot to hack other computers and more!

We'll be created correlated subqueries, where the results of the subquery depend on the main query. We'll be looking at Common Table Expressions using the WITH statement, and we'll be using what we have learned to solve a common business problem.\r\n\r\nWe'll be looking at functions (objective 14), including the three different types of User Defined Functions (UDF): scalar functions, inline table functions, and multi-statement table functions. We'll then complete objective 6 by looking at synonyms and dynamic SQL, and objective 8 by looking at the use of GUIDs. We'll also look at sequences.\r\n\r\nWe'll have a look at XML. Finally, for SQL Server 2016 and later (exam 70-761), we'll examine JSON and Temporal Tables.\r\n\r\nSession 7\r\n\r\nIn this session we'll be looking at transactions, seeing how to explicitly start and end them, and finding out how they can block other users in the database.

You just can't prepare enough for this one.\r\n\r\nThis certification prep course is taught by Frank Kane, who spent nine years working at Amazon itself in the field of machine learning.

And I love making complex technical topics easy to understand. \r\n\r\n    This has been the basis of my entire career û as a developer, as a development manager, as a software architect û over the past 20 years. I spend half my time in the world of business, explaining complex technical topics to business owners and stakeholders so that they can understand and agree with my approach to solving their business problems with technical solutions. And the other half with developers, explaining the business reasons behind decisions and ensuring that any decisions made on the technical side don't restrict the business in unexpected ways. \r\n\r\n    And I'm here on Udemy to teach what I know in an approachable way. I started teaching courses in 2014, and have taught over 600,000 students. I am grateful every day for being able to connect with so many students in almost every country around the world.\r\n\r\n    I'm a certified Enterprise Architect and certified cloud architect. I have been developing with Microsoft technologies for 20 years, starting with Classic ASP, and all the versions of .NET.
